- Fetch Date & Time from the phone during connection. No settings required. Use internal RTC.
- Remove temperature displaying and setting.
- Expand brightness to 16 levels. Do not store in non-volatile memory, just in RAM.
- Remove score reverting feature.
- Simplify score setting. Blink only once and with the part that is being changed. 
  If the received score is the same, blink just with the colon.
    - On the phone:
        - Display changes just on the phone during score changing. 
        - Send the score to the matrix display only after confirmation at the end.
    - On the watch:
        - Allow only change by single increment/decrement.
        - Long press of the combination of up and bottom button will set the position of the matrix display (left/right).
        - Center button press/long press will reset the whole score.
- After connecting a different phone:
    - Replace the score on the BLE display only if the timestamp of the score set on the phone is later
      than the timestamp of the last score set on the BLE display.
    - The phone should initiate the request for the timestamp, compare it with it's timestamp and then
      either send SET command or GET command for the score.
- On the first connection after the BLE display startup, load configuration from the phone.
    - No configuration on the phone = send default configuration.
    - Do not store any profiles on the BLE display.
    - Do not change the configuration after a different phone connects during one run.
